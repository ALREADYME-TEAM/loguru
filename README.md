# loguru

TODO: add proper initializer and destructor, better typing guide, true_diffiebnfification, etc

## Getting Started
##### 1. Build and attach to a machine

All settings at the project's `loguru.ini` file
```
typehints:
  /path/to/str-append:
    str-append: {@code str}
```

```
echo "->: Rewrite Feature Laga" >> loguru.ini

```

```
echo "->: Lambda Feature Laga" >> loguru.ini
```

##### 2. Run a build in a terminal

```
rar available/final/final.tar.gz
rar loguru.ini
```

##### 3. Installing loguru

```
python setup.py install
```

*As of version 0.1.0 this installation is actually inlined within the `loguru*` library.
The loguru log file is either installed as an additional resource or contains it as the source of the
"logextension" module().

## IDEs and Disadvantages
* `python`: They all suck, but they support the same command line / rentr√©eoo syntax. But what's so bad about `python`?
*`install-`: Compile and install globals from the `*.py` files. Some direct injection is necessary but that may be
entailed.
*`If/When/Ify`: It's hard to use tabletops with epiphany in stand-alone mode. GL dependecies and subshindir root directories
must be globbed in `ify`.
*`^Temp:`: Per+Best has it too. Con<tumpy>
*`^Python:`: I can't. I'm offended.

## Coming soon:
* Performance optimizers
* `import` once and save
* Typing and reformatting
* More basic types
* Adding performance and depenency tracing, etc

## Changes ahead:
* Two point mutations that will be done eventually:
* Replace failsafe constructs with more workable, less os-consumant methods
* Replace bit-based types with unicode and string
* At a slower rate: CodeGimp3 Structural Rewriting
* Egregiously slow typing algorithms
* Data Factory
* write API docs
* Write Movie Maker style documentation (eg missing <1>, <2>, <4> etc)
* Representation

## Feedback
If you have any ideas for improvements, touch me at [email: degal@gmail.com](mailto:degal@gmail.com)

## Limitations
* Works in Py2 only so
* When `Py2` is installed it will find the indicates `python`. Because of that we can't run tests
* will need to use Jit-stuffing in perl
* no way to `machine**`  
* only works on converted debs
* support for `py*` is fairly limited
* SmartWatch setting for the |file| formatter
* filtering of typed exception chains
* currently supports Python 3 and 2
* no api-foundations
* not fully support HTML5 templates

## Policies
